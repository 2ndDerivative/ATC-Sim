# ATC-Sim

Trying my hand at a small air traffic control game programmed in Rust.
Radio calls are supposed to be issued by text instead of buttons and the planes (may) act on their own on commands you issue or don't issue.

## Development Status

As I am doing this as a side project with varying motivation over time, the "game" right now is basically a random plane generator. Bear with me writing this over a long time and feel free to fork and suggest changes. I am new to Bevy and will be glad to hear your feedback.

Next development steps is adding runways and an altitude system for the airplanes.

Upcoming parts of project:
- Full airplane movement
- Runways
- Radio calls issueable
- Airplane AI
- Weather (Wind, Clouds)
